There is one global variable which is incrementing from 1 to 100
you should have two threads
one thread printing the odd numbers alone
other thread printing the even numbers alone
Another important requirement is that the odd number printing thread should print first
implement it using conditional variable
printing should be sequential like odd 1,even 2,odd 3,even 4,odd 5,even 6 and so on by two threads
